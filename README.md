# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Project
 A decision tree classifier to predict neutron interaction events as part of the research at the Virginia State University Nuclear Science Lab, specifically for the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) project. The focus is on classifying neutron trajectories using machine learning techniques based on measurements from scintillator detector arrays.
